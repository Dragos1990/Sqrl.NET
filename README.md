GRC SQRL Library for .NET

# Test Data Needed

We need to define some test cases for the encoding/decoding of data as well as example 
data for the encryption/decryption values.

- 72-bit nonce
- 256-bit public key
- 512-bit signature
- example web challenge
- example client response

By creating this test data, we can verify that all code is using the algorithms correctly.
